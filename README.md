These are the projects I have created to improve my knowledge in the Ionic Framework and how to use it in my every-day projects.  Below I have listed the projects that are currently in this repository and everything I have added/implemented in those projects.

## Conference App
The Conference App is a stand-alone pre-created template that is provided by Ionic to let developers see the potential they have with the Ionic Framework.  Below are screenshots of the working project.

To run it for yourself, please download this ZIP File containing this project.  Once you have extracted the project, open it in your preferred IDE (I would suggest using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  When your IDE has completed loading (in this case: VSCode), press ``` Ctrl +  ` ```.  This will  open the Terminal Window.  In the Terminal, type in the following:
```
ionic serve
```
Then press ```Enter```
