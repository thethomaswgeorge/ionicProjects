# My [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) Projects Listings

### Date Started: 3/6/2020 | Date Uploaded: 4/7/2020 ###

These are the projects I have created to improve my knowledge in the Ionic Framework and how to use it in my every-day projects.  Below I have listed the projects that are currently in this repository and everything I have added/implemented in those projects.

To run any of these projects for yourself, please download this ZIP File containing all the projects.  Once you have extracted the project, open the specific app folder you have in mind to run in your preferred IDE (I would suggest using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  When your IDE has completed loading (in this case: VSCode), press ``` Ctrl +  ` ```.  This will  open the Terminal Window.  In the Terminal, type in the following:
```
ionic serve
```
Then press ```Enter```


### Conference App (ConferenceApp)
The Conference App is a stand-alone pre-created template that is provided by Ionic to let developers see the potential they have with the Ionic Framework.  Below are screenshots of the working project.



### Super App (superApp)
Super App was another pre-created template to get you started in the world of creating your own Ionic Apps.

### My Side Menu (MySideMenu)
### Tabular App (tabsAngular)
This was my first real project I created in the Ionic Framework and really got to mess with.  In the project, I was wanted to find out all there is to every type of UI elements you can possibly add as well as possible add-ons that would enhance Ionic Apps.  For instance, one Add-On I wanted to see if they had was the ability to use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icons.  With a little searching on the web I found out they have their very own icons called [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/).  This allowed me to customize and really bring the feel of the app to a more unique level than it was before.

## In The Near Future Projects

### MySQL CRUD App


This will be filled in soon..
